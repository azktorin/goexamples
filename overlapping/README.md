[goexamples](https://github.com/azkdev/goexamples) - OverLapping
=========================================================================

## Our task:

Define a function overlapping() that takes two lists and returns "true" if they have at least one member in common, "false" otherwise. We should write it using two nested for-loops.

## For installing it and run

Just fallow it step by step:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/azkdev/goexamples
```
```
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/azkdev/goexamples/overlapping
```
```
$ go install
```

And just run it.

```
$ overlapping
```

## Result

Result should be output something like this:

```
Are there members in common? - true
```
